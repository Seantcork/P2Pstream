DONE:
  requestJoin
  Join
  removeDeadNode
  requestNewProvider

TODO next:
  Notice dead node (on failed RMI)
  Add time stamps to use as new chain metric
    offset =

TODO later:

  make node lookups faster, maybe hashmap? (Ip -> [chain][index])... but wont update
  Leave willingly ( call remove dead node with self, update down stream node with new provider )

TESTABLE Variables
  offset threshold
  cache size
  num missed DB due to discrepancy
