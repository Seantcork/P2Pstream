DONE:
  requestJoin
  Join
  removeDeadNode
  requestNewProvider

TODO next:
  Add time stamps to use as new chain metric
  Set up request in a time chain instead of while loop.


TODO later:

  Leave willingly ( call remove dead node with self, update down stream node with new provider )
  
TESTABLE Variables
