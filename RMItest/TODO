DONE:
  requestJoin
  Join
  removeDeadNode
  requestNewProvider
  Timing request data.
  Datablock done -- timestamp in ms and 2000000 bytes of 'a's delimited by a comma
  fix output of print index so its more legible
  send dataBlock


TODO next:
  make the cache
  compare data block timestamp to local timestamp and calculate difference
  start new chain() function

TODO later:

  make node lookups faster, maybe hashmap? (Ip -> [chain][index])... but wont update
  Leave willingly ( call remove dead node with self, update down stream node with new provider )

TESTABLE Variables
  offset threshold
  cache size
  num missed DB due to discrepancy
