  compare data block timestamp to local timestamp and calculate difference
  start new chain() function

TODO next:
  Cacheing stuff.

TODO later:

  make node lookups faster, maybe hashmap? (Ip -> [chain][index])... but wont update
  Leave willingly ( call remove dead node with self, update down stream node with new provider )

TESTABLE Variables
  offset threshold
  cache size
  num missed DB due to discrepancy
