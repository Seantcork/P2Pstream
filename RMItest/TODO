  Timing request data.
  Data block done -- timestamp in ms and 2000000 bytes of 'a's delimited by a comma
  fix output of print index so its more legible

TODO next:
  send dataBlock
  compare data block timestamp to local timestamp and calculate difference


TODO later:

  make node lookups faster, maybe hashmap? (Ip -> [chain][index])... but wont update
  Leave willingly ( call remove dead node with self, update down stream node with new provider )

TESTABLE Variables
  offset threshold
  cache size
  num missed DB due to discrepancy
